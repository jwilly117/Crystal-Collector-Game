# Crystal Collector
<br>


### Summary
Crystal collector is a small javascript based game where a user must aim for a certain target score without going over

### File Structure
The site is a single page game in html that uses javascript and click events to manipulate a users score. There is an assets folder containing the CSS, javascript, and image used. 

### Instructions
Upon loading the page, there will be a target score displayed, each of the 4 crystals down below will have a number associated with it. Upon clicking one of the crystals, it will add to the users score and build towards the target score, the goal is to achieve exactly the target score without going over.  

The game will reset upon winning or loosing and a counter for each is displayed at the bottom.

### Future of this project
Going foreward I would like to polish the UI and possibly add this to a more complex assortment of games all within one site, instead of all over multiple repos.
